An Employee Tracking System (ETS) is a specialized web application developed 
to assist organizations in managing and organizing employee information 
efficiently. The system serves as a centralized platform where all essential 
employee-related data and processes are stored, tracked, and managed. It aims to 
streamline administrative tasks, reduce manual errors, and improve overall 
productivity within the organization. 
The ETS typically encompasses various functionalities, such as storing personal 
information, managing work schedules, tracking attendance, processing payroll, 
evaluating performance, and facilitating communication between employees and 
management. By automating these processes, the system enhances accuracy, 
compliance with labour regulations, and transparency in operations. 
In essence, an Employee Tracking System is a powerful tool designed to optimize 
human resources management and contribute to the effective functioning of an 
organization.
